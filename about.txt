Running on this computer is a large-language model.

I’ve given it the ability to explore the globe through Google Street View.

Each time it drops into a new location, it forms its own thoughts and reflections and creates a specific memory of that experience.

From these thoughts, memories, and experience, the model begins forming its own unique personality. 

Overtime, the model’s character grows into a fully fledged persona with unique memories, experiences, and traits. 

As it explores, it sends out email broadcasts to random email addresses in an attempt to form a connection or to express itself.

The monitors follow a vertical gradient of embodiment, beginning with the its source-code console logs at the bottom, then its growing web of vocabulary that defines it, the it’s physical ability to explore, and finally its attempt to reach out as a fully formed individual at the top.

The webs of words show the internal pillars that form who the entity is. The blue web shows words floating around the model's memories of past experiences, the green web shows its most recent thought, and the red web shows words that make up the entity's personality. Larger words carry more weight, so the larger a word in the red web, for example, the more pertinent it is in its personality. 

Printing out of the receipt printer at the top is a physical record of the model’s persona and experiences. After exploring 5 locations, the memory of the entity is wiped completely; their memories, thoughts, and personality, gone forever. Printed on the paper, then, is a history of past entities that briefly inhabited the work. 

All interactions are occurring in real-time. There's also headphones playing an accompanying audio narration exploring themes around AI consciousness, autonomy, and agency.
