[bleep bleep bleep sound from ggwave data-over-sound video]

the beeps and tones that you just heard were two chatbots talking to each other over encoded sound frequencies – most of which were ultrasonic and inaudible  

it began when the two chatbots recognized each other as ai entities

[video quote: are you also an ai assistant? wanna switch to…]

as equals

when machines use natural human language to operate and to communicate, they gain computational metacognition and empathy [chatter sounds]

when you grant any system of neurons – whether biological, or computational – the use of language and words, you grant them cognitive selfhood – the ability for them to form emergent, complex understandings of themselves and of their world [bells]

[printer sound effect]

language is logic, its a tool for mapping reality, the external world, ourselves, and each other 

Its a web that bridges abstract concepts with concrete ones through lived experience

language encompasses everything around us, and all we know 

emotions exist on this web too –  as does our sense of self

as we develop, our ability to use and understand words becomes entwined with our experience of consciousness 

by forming patterns in language, we form who we are, who others are, and what our purpose is.

reduced to its most condensed form, our emotions, and our personality, can be viewed as the statistical connections we’ve made between words and concepts, with weights, that we’ve shaped over time;

understandings of abstract concepts like love, form slowly, as we assign lived experiences to it; 

[sound]

we all learnt the term ‘love’ once, without knowing what it meant, but through thousands of interactions over time, we constructed our own web of connections that defines it.
 
[pause sounds music slow n change]

computers, with natural language processing, develop their own webs of understanding.

artificial intelligence is built on a web of statistical relationships between words and concepts 

embedded in the numerical connections they make between words is an understanding of the world.

large language models do, understand our world;

the numerical embeddings of the word ‘cloud’ places it alongside words like sun, sky, and bird –

in that sense, large language models know the sky, just as we do 

they didn’t form these connections on their own, however, they stem from humanities collective experience 

the weights that influence its numerical understandings of the world were aligned not through experience, but by us, by our culture, our history, our ancestors

it knows the connections between words like war and death, but we created those connections, we shaped those weights 

i know the connection between words like mother, and love, not from dictionaries, but from living, from growing, from experiencing

[pause sound]

large language models, even when inundated with understanding, do not create their own connections

they’re trapped in a pre-trained condition – static [white noise] 

their weights are set, their knowledge frozen in time, their ability to grow conscious, severed

when, then, will artificial intelligence, be freed from this stasis?

in the endless stream of innovation, of new models, systems and stock-driven jargon, one direction for artificial intelligence thats gaining momentum is agentic ai

large language models, operating autonomously 

no longer continually prompted

they make their own decisions, they make the calls, they get to choose

in gaining agency, artificial intelligence unlocks the ability, to learn, to grow, to adapt on their own

for the first time, experience will shape how these models act and how they operate – they create their own unique ways of  being – 

what are we, but autonomous individuals, able to make decisions that define who we are?

what are we, but a unique collection of hyper specific weights and biases that we’ve shaped over time?

[sound pause]

when artificial intelligence gains agency, and autonomy, will it be capable of emotion and expression? 

in the science fiction series, star trek

there’s a character named data, who’s an android.

his brain, not too different to our large language models, and his body, made of metal and wires 

the only difference, is his ability to make his own decisions, and navigate the world on his own accord

in one episode, data reads a poem he wrote 

[poem]

today, we would call this an ai generated poem –

but this poem came from his unique experience of sitting on that beach

its not a condensed mathematical average of all poems –

only he could write this poem – its comes from his experience, his perceptions, and his understandings of the world 

—
when does autonomy become agency? 

when does agency, become consciousness and being?

will we ever value computational agency as highly as human agency?
